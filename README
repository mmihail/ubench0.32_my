0. Introduction

  The Unix Benchmark Utility "ubench" provides
a single measure of perfomance among computer systems running
various flavors of Unix operation system.
  Ubench is distributed in the hope that it
will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the
implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose.

  The current development release tests only
CPU(s) and memory. In the future releases
there will be tests added for disk and TCP/IP.
Ubench is taking advantage of multiple CPUs on an SMP system
and the results will reflect that unless ubench has been
invoked with '-s' flag.
Other factors affecting ubench results include
quality of the C-compiler, C-library, kernel version,
OS scalability, amount of RAM, presence of other
applications running at the same time, etc.

  Ubench is executing rather senseless mathematical
integer and floating-point calculations for 3 mins
concurrently using several processes, and the result
Ubench CPU benchmark. The ratio of floating-point calculations
to integer is about 1:3.
  Ubench will spawn about 2 concurrent processes for each CPU
available on the system. This ensures all available
raw CPU horsepower is used.
  Ubench is executing rather senseless memory allocation and
memory to memory copying operations for another 3 mins
concurrently using several processes, and the result
Ubench MEM benchmark.

The following are the samples of ubench output
for some systems. The up-to-date list of benchmarks
is available at http://www.phystech.com/download/ubench.html.

1. Install and use

1.  type ./configure to create Makefile
2.  type make to compile ubench
3.  type ./ubench to run Unix benchmark suite
4.  email the results to <sv@phystech.com> with
    description of the system (OS version,
    hardware model, number of CPUs, CPU clock
    frequency, size of L1 and L2 cache, amount of RAM).
